# boilerplate_azure_function_app
This is a repository that can be used for local testing and debugging of azure function apps in Pycharm. Everything can be tested via the PyCharm terminal. No usage of other tools needed. For deployment of the function app in Azure, follow the guide in my corresponding repository (to be continued).

## How to use
- clone repo
- switch to folder where the function resides
- run pip install -r requirements.txt
- type "func start"
- quit with "ctrl + c"
- restart function if desired
